All cases to cover should be interpreted as the descartes
product of the following:
- Invertibility: `invertible` or `non-invertible`

## Use Cases
- [ ] Fork-Join: I must be able to fork and join tasks
- [ ] Nested Fork-Join: I must be able to nest/combine fork and join tasks into forked and joined tasks
- [ ] Utility usage: I must be able to use utility tasks
- [ ] Nested Utility usage: I must be able to nest/combine utility tasks into utility tasks
