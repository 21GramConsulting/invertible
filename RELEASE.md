# 1.1.1

First release post-migration.
Project was migrated from 21GramConsulting to adam-rocska.

## Patch Changes

- Only related to bundling, building, testing, and
  publishing, the library API, nor its implementation should
  have changed.
- I decided to dump the typedoc docs. Typedoc is awful. It
  looks like shit, works like shit, and doesn't add value
  other than maybe some clumsy SEO hopes. This library will
  soon have its own superdox once I'm done with my OSS rampage.
